# InstaStock

InstaStock is a Python-based automation tool that monitors the stock status of a specified product on Amazon.in in real-time. It periodically scrapes the product page, checks availability status, and sends an email alert when the product is back in stock or available for purchase.

The project is designed to help users track fast-selling or out-of-stock items without manually refreshing product pages. It's especially useful for purchasing high-demand items like electronics, books, or limited-time deals.
